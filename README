We have a list of millions of dates, stored in a database.

We'd like to convert these dates to a moment object, so we can perform date calculations on them.

We need the objects to stay in their local timezone, so we're using `moment.parseZone()` to convert them.

However, we're seeing very long parse times, and we'd like to speed them up.

We need to improve the performance of `moment.parseZone()`. Let's see if we can do it!

`benchmarks.js` contains a benchmark suite.

`index.js` is some example code that we can use outside the context of a benchmark.
